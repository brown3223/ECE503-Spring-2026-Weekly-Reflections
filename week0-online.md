### Week 0: Key concepts and themes (Jan 20, 2026)
- Discrete-time signals, e.g.,
  - unit impulse $\delta[n]$
  - unit step $u[n]$
  - exponential signals $a^n$
- Discrete-time systems
  - Focus of ECE503 is on linear time-invariant (LTI) systems 
- Representations of systems:
  - Linear constant coefficient difference equations
  - Impulse response $h[n]$
- Other system properties: 
  - BIBO stability
  - Causal 
  - Memoryless
- Convolution
  - only useful for LTI systems (this is a consequence of the linearity and time invariance of the system)
