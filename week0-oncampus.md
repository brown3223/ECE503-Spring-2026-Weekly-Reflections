### Week 0: key concepts & themes (Jan 21, 2026)
- History of DSP
- Advantages and disadvantages of DSP compared to analog SP
- Basics of DSP - graphs and functions
- Discrete time signals, e.g.,
  - unit impulse $\delta[n]$
  - unit step $u[n]$
  - periodicity $x[n] = x[n-N]$
  - exponential (real $a^n$ and complex $e^{j\omega n}$)
- Discrete time systems and their properties:
  - memoryless
  - linearity
  - time-invariance
  - causality
  - stability
- Ways of representing LTI discrete-time systems (in the time domain):
  - Impulse response
  - Linear constant coefficient difference equations
- Convolution review (consequence of linearity and time invariance of a system)
- Tiny bit of Matlab in the final screencast
  - {\tt conv} function
  - {\tt filter} function
  - Use the Matlab symbolic toolbox to check your algebra/calculus!
  - Usually Matlab is useful for numerical simulation to test the theory (midterm project)
